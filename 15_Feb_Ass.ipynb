    "# Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows the creation of multiple processes, \n",
    "# each of which runs independently and in parallel. This is useful for performing \n",

    "# performance and resource utilization on multi-core systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "# - Multiprocessing involves creating multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter\n",
    "#   and memory space, which avoids the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and can leverage multiple\n",
    "#   CPU cores. It is suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "# - Multithreading involves creating multiple threads within a single process. Threads share\n",
    "#   the same memory space and can be affected by the GIL, which can limit performance for\n",
